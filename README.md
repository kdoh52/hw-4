# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

This website application is a 5-question quiz about Javascript, intended to help a student track their learning progress.

The basic structure includes a navigation bar that toggles between the quiz and the high score list. 

The quiz tab shows instructional text and a timer that begins at 75 and counts down once the test has begun. If the user answers a question correctly, they will receive a point. If they answer incorrectly, ten seconds will be subtracted from their timer. When the timer reaches 0 or the user answers all 5 questions, the test is over.

The end text shows what the user's final score is, and allows them to submit it along with their name/initials. This will appear on the high score tab, and persists until the "Clear scores" button is pressed.
